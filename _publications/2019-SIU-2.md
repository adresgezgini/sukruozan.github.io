excerpt: 'This   study   presents   the   development   of   a   voiceactivity  detection  (VAD)  system  tested  on  call  center  telephonydata  obtained  from  our  local  site.  The  concept  of  bag  of  audiowords (BoAW) combined with a naive Bayes classifier was appliedto  achieve  the  task.  It  was  formulated  as  a  binary  classificationproblem with speech as the positive class and silence/backgroundnoise as the negative class. All the processing was performed onthe Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) extracted fromthe audio recordings. The results which are presented as accuracyscore  and  receiver  operating  characteristics  (ROC)  indicate  anexcellent performance of the developed model. The system is to bedeployed within our call center to aid data analysis and improveoverall  efficiency  of  the  center.'
